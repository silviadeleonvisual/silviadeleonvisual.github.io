      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this happens to you, but for me, the need to take paper and pen when I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain something is innate. Even to understand a process, I need to make drawings to clarify my ideas. A few boxes, a couple of arrows and titles and voila.
Does it happen to you? Well, that is one more way to use Visual Thinking.
What happens is that it is easier to describe complex concepts with drawings and relationships than with words.</description>

      <description>I will start saying this is not an art, it is not something new or something that only artists can do.
Have you ever played pictionary? Have you ever needed to do some doodling to explain something or to understand it? I&amp;rsquo;m sure you have, and for sure, using basic structures, you achieved what you needed: to express something by drawing.
When you were little, I&amp;rsquo;m sure you drawed a lot without thinking your draws were good or bad, you just expressed yourself.</description>
