      <description>My name is Silvia and I am a Computer Engineer passionate about drawing and handcraft things.
Since I finished my degree&amp;hellip;..in 2014, I have being a developer, mainly javascript. During these years, I have worked in companies that used Agiles methodologies where visualization is really important. So, when I discovered Visual Thinking was something, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help myself to learn about it. Being able to join my profesion and my hobby is just awesome.</description>
